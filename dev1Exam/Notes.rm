## TO DO

- Study salesforce order of execution



## NOTES

- Trigger best practices: one trigger per object, keep triggers logic-less, control triggers with declaritive functionality (use custom settings or custom metadata types to turn triggers on/off)
- Three static modifiers that can be applied to classes, methods, and variables: global, public, private
    - global means that it can be accessed by any code within the entire org; public means it is only accessible by code in the same namespace; private means that it is only accessible by the class that defines it
- sharing is dictated by the definition of the top level class called
- Decimal and double are both valid and the same data types. 
- salesforce id primitive data type has to conform to criteria (15/18 characters)
- all SObjects fall under Object type (shared methods)
- List<String> and String[] are the same
- you can create a map of ID -> SObject by simply passing in a list of SObjects
