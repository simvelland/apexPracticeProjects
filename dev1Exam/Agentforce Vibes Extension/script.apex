// Agentforce Vibes Extension
- a suite of agentic AI tools designed to transform developer productivity and execute complex development workflows automatically
- Key features: 
    - Agentforce, an intelligent development partner that takes action. Agentfoce can execute commands, perform complex workflows automatically, and connect directly to your SF org. 
    - Agentforce reduces context switching between tools and streamlines testing, deployment, and metadata operations throuhg natural language conversations.
    - Inline autocompletions for Apex and LWC
    - Test Case Generation for Apex and LWC
    - can execute commands and code following org's existing naming conventions
    - is familiar with org settings 
    - uses metadata and structure to provide intelligent, contextual assistance
    - Agentforce Rules allow you to establish consitent coding standards and project-specific preferences that Agentforce follows throughout your development sessions. 
    - create rules through Agentforce's interface or by using the /newrule command in chat 


// Speed Development with Autocompletions and Test Generation
- Agentforce revolutionizes test creation by understanding your code context and automatically generating comprehensive test suites that cover various scenarios, edge cases, and business logic requirements.
- Agentforce understands existing codebase and testing patterns. Agentforce automatically: 
    - follows your organization's testing conventions and naming patterns
    - creates realistic test data based on your object relations
    - generates tests that complement your existing test suite without duplication
    - includes proper assertions, setup methods, and teardown procedures
    - ensures tests align with your security model and sharing rules

// Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants like Agentfoce to securely connect with external tools, data sources, and services. 
- MCP is important because it transforms Agentforce from a standalone coding tool into a comprehensive development ecosystem. 
- Instead of being limited to generating code based on its training data, Agentforce can now access real-time information, interact with development tools, query databases, and integrate with third-party services- all while maintaining security and privacy standards. 
- With the Salesforce DX MCP server, Agentforce can:
    Query your org's schema and metadata in real time.
    Access custom object definitions, field configurations, and relationships.
    Retrieve and analyze existing Apex classes, triggers, and Lightning components.
    Understand your org's security model, permission sets, and profiles.
    Generate code that's perfectly aligned with your org's specific configuration.
    Suggest optimizations based on your actual data model and usage patterns.
- MCP integration transforms how you interact with Agentforce. Instead of providing context manually, MCP servers automatically supply relevant information about your development environment.
