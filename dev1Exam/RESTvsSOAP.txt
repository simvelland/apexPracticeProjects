- API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two software systems to communicate
- REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources
	- Everything is treated as a resource
	- HTTP verbs: GET retrieves data, POST creates data, PUT updates data, and DELETE removes data
	- Stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed; the server doesn't remember previous requests
	- Data format is usually JSON, but can also be XML, YAML, etc. 
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
	- protocol for exchanging structured information using XML
	- it's more rigid but provides built-in standards for security, transactions, and error handling
	- uses XML exclusively for data format
	- operates over multiple protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.)
	- Has a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file describing all available operations and data types
	- Supports stateful operations
	- Often used in enterprise or financial systems where strict standards and reliability matter
