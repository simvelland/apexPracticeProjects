/* Aura Components 
- An aura:attribute is what we use to store data within an Aura component
- You can access the attribute in the code using the value provider v. as v.recordId or v.Account. Value providers are a way to access data by encapsulating related values together, similar to how an object encapsulates properties and methods.
